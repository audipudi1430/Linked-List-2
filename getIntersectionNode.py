# This solution finds the intersection node of two singly linked lists by first calculating their lengths.
# It then aligns both pointers by advancing the longer listâ€™s pointer by the length difference.
# Finally, it moves both pointers one step at a time until they meet at the intersection or reach the end.

# Time Complexity: O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two linked lists.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as only a constant amount of space is used.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
